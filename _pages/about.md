I am a computer science and data science double major at UC Berkeley, driven by a passion for leveraging data and technology to solve complex, real-world problems. With a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience in areas like financial forecasting, secure file storage, and AI-based analytics, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in data science. My interests extend to sports analytics, EdTech, and cybersecurity, where I aim to use my skills to create meaningful and lasting impact.

My academics
------
As a result of my double major, I have pursued coursework that fuels my curiosity in the intersection between computer science and data science. Most notably, I have delved into subjects such as data structures, efficient algorithms, machine structures, computer security, database systems, artificial intelligence, and advanced data science techniques. Each course has provided a unique lens through which I explore how data and computational methods can drive decision-making and innovation in technology.

In my role as a tutor for an upper-division data science course (DATA C100), I apply this academic foundation to support others, reinforcing my own understanding and expanding my knowledge through teaching. These academic pursuits have not only shaped my technical skills but also fueled my drive to explore how computer science and data science intersect to solve real-world problems.

My communities
------
I am actively engaged in the UC Berkeley data science community, serving as the Internal Vice President of the Data Science Society. In this role, I focus on making data science more accessible and providing professional development opportunities for members. I host educational and career-focused workshops, such as resume reviews, and manage the UC Berkeley course 'Introduction to Real World Data Science.' Additionally, as a Senior Mentor for Computer Science Mentors, I lead supplementary teaching sections in data structures and mentor members in effective pedagogical techniques. These experiences have honed my leadership skills and reinforced my dedication to fostering a supportive and collaborative computer science and data science community.

My background
------
I am a Bay Area native who has always been passionate about helping others, whether through tutoring, mentoring, or teaching. I attended Holy Rosary Catholic School before moving forward to Dozier-Libbey Medical High School. As I focused on my studies at DLMHS, I also played basketball for Antioch High School, where I learned the importance of teamwork and discipline.

While my school did not offer formal opportunities to explore computer science or data science in a classroom setting, I sought out ways to develop my passion for these fields. I participated as an intern for NAF Future Ready Scholars at UC Berkeley, which introduced me to the fundamentals of programming, robotics, and career-readiness. This experience ignited my curiosity and laid the foundation for my journey into computer science and data science. These early experiences shaped my commitment to making technical knowledge accessible to others, a goal I continue to pursue at UC Berkeley.
