I am a computer science and data science double major at UC Berkeley, driven by a passion for leveraging data and technology to solve complex, real-world problems. With a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience in areas like financial forecasting, secure file storage, and AI-based analytics, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in data science. My interests extend to sports analytics, EdTech, and cybersecurity, where I aim to use my skills to create meaningful and lasting impact.

My academics
------
As a result of my double major, I have pursued coursework that fuels my curiosity in the intersection between computer science and data science. Most notably, I have delved into subjects such as data structures, efficient algorithms, machine structures, computer security, database systems, artificial intelligence, and advanced data science techniques. Each course has provided a unique lens through which I explore how data and computational methods can drive decision-making and innovation in technology.

In my role as a tutor for an upper-division data science course (DATA C100), I apply this academic foundation to support others, reinforcing my own understanding and expanding my knowledge through teaching. These academic pursuits have not only shaped my technical skills but also fueled my drive to explore how computer science and data science intersect to solve real-world problems.

My communities
------
I am actively engaged in the UC Berkeley data science community, serving as the Internal Vice President of the Data Science Society. In this role, I focus on making data science more accessible and providing professional development opportunities for members. I host educational and career-focused workshops, such as resume reviews, and manage the UC Berkeley course 'Introduction to Real World Data Science.' Additionally, as a Senior Mentor for Computer Science Mentors, I lead supplementary teaching sections in data structures and mentor members in effective pedagogical techniques. These experiences have honed my leadership skills and reinforced my dedication to fostering a supportive and collaborative computer science and data science community.

My background
------
I am a Bay Area native who spent my early years at Holy Rosary Catholic School. Immediately, I developed a love for helping others through various community service projects and peer tutoring programs. This early experience sparked my passion for teaching and mentoring, which would continue to shape my journey in later years.

In high school, I attended Dozier-Libbey Medical High School, where I was introduced to a more rigorous medical-focused curriculum. Despite limited opportunities in computer science and data science at school, I was determined to explore these fields. I took the initiative to learn programming independently, driven by my curiosity about how technology can solve real-world problems. I balanced my academic pursuits with playing basketball for Antioch High School, which taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and time management.

To gain formal experience in technology, I participated in the NAF Future Ready Scholars program at UC Berkeley. There, I acquired foundational skills in programming, robotics, and career-readiness, discovering the excitement of building and problem-solving with technology. This experience not only laid the foundation for my passion in computer science and data science, but also reinforced my commitment to making the fields more accessible for others.
