I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Data Science.

Outside of my academics, I serve as a course tutor (UCS1) for UC Berkeley's upper-division data science course, DATA C100. Oftentimes, I can be found holding office hours, answering questions on Ed Discussion, and improving/reviewing content for the course. In addition, I am the Internal Vice President for Data Science Society at Berkeley, where I focus my efforts on bringing professional development opportunities to our organization's members. Lastly, I am a Senior Mentor for Computer Science Mentors at UC Berkeley. Here, I serve as a mentor for those looking to improve upon their data structure/algorithm knowledge, and provide supplemental teaching to a small group of students.

On the technical front, I am involved in several projects ranging from web development to a full-stack data science application to natural language processing. Overall, I possess proficiency in Python, Java, C Golang, x86, RISC-V, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have expertise in data science libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and NLTK.
